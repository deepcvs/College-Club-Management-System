# DBMS-Project

This project deals with the creation of a Clubs Management Interface. The interface helps manage all the clubs and centres of an university, keeping track of all their expenses, events, committee, participants, sponsors etc.

The project is entirely written in python, using TKinter for the frontend and PostgreSQL as the database.
The project can be run by executing the following command
```
python frontend.py
```

The other python files in data generation folder deal with the generation of random data, whose output can be viewed in the docs folder. The text files in the docs folder are combined in the insert_commands.sql file.

Steps to execute:

* Run the create_commands.sql
* Generate random data as per your wish using the python files in data generation folder (Optional). Run the insert_commands.sql file.
* Finally run the frontend.py file.
